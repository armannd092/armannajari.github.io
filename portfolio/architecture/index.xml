      <description>This research project studies and analyses the performance of timber laminates with MUF (melamine urea-formaldehyde) resin and wood particles (sawdust). Timber laminates are pre-programmed by understanding its behavior through simulations with the help of computational tools. Advanced learning and using digital tools will always help to push boundaries for understanding a material better. Its properties to react with different materials, applied forces, physical attributes etc. is crucial to investigate in order to understand their behavior, especially while studying those of new composites.</description>

      <description>Good wood is a new perspective to Recycling wood with the help of computational design and robotic fabrication. This project tries to present a process to target the scrap wood, which left from the construction as a base material to build a shelter. This approach gets advantages from computational tools and robotic fabrication to detect, match, and fabricate the elements of the shell.

      <description>Architecture is a discipline that forces mathematics to escape the theoretical realm and confront the tangible. With Islamic patterns - as a singular example of the integration of mathematics in design - the application in the world of craft, as ceramic tiles, results in the complex non-hierarchical superficial motives that ornament so many spaces of the Islamic world.

      <description>Hyperloop LA was experimentation on the minimal surfaces as an architectural geometry to contain a hyperloop station in Los Angeles. This study started by base component study and continued toward a parametric development of it. With the manipulation of the geometry regardless of the architectural function the capability of the component has been found. Based on this knowledge, a broad catalog of the component was produced, which was the foundation of the final design of the station.</description>

      <description>The agenda is to further push the fabrication of curved surfaces with composite materials. However this time, the design studies of the work will be shifted from pure mathematics to the work and legacy of Felix Candela which still features a good deal of math and geometry in his works. By ‘Re-Envisioning Candela’, the idea is to study the intricacy as well as technicality and methodology of his work and to push it towards further computational design of the shell/surface geometries.</description>
